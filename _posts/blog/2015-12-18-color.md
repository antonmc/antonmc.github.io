When I look around at branding, I shake my head at how easy it seems for some people to choose a color. It's one of the aspects of design that I find the most challenging.

The recent branding for the Apple TV for instance had me smiling ...

When I look at it I think how wonderful a design it is, and how important color is within it. Little choices impress me, like drawing the apple logo on an orange background ... where orange is a color associated with trust. The widths of the color bars, the combination of colors, how well they work together, how modern they are, how fresh it makes a test card look, yet still distinctively Apple.

I don't think I could ever find such a nice combination of colors.

The color scheme for ['Summer Tomato'](http://www.summertomato.com) ( along with the simple, yet beautiful iconography there ) is another combination that I marvel at:

Recently I've been taking inspiration from Pantone. Twice a year they give people like me a gift, a ['fashion conscious combination of colors'](http://www.pantone.com/pages/fcr/?season=spring&year=2016&pid=11) for Spring and Fall:
