A week or so ago I wrote about the corporate service corps assignment that I'd be working on in Brazil in August. I want to try and blog about the experience as I go along. 

This week I learned a little more. I learned who the people in my group will be, and where they come from. There are a dozen people on my team, from ten countries:

    * Canada
    * Japan
Singapore
Korea
Germany
Slovakia
China
USA
Ireland
Vietnam

I'll be working and hanging out with them for four weeks, so I have the opportunity to learn not just about Brazil's culture, but about culture from six countries I've never been to.

Our pre-work for the assignment begins on May 8th, so I'll start to add more notes here, as I learn more about the assignment.
