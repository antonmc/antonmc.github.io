More than 2300 attendees have made the trip to Agile 2015 here in Washington, perhaps already convinced of the transformative nature of an agile process, or eager to learn new ways to tune their existing one.

As a scrum trained developer myself, it's interesting for me to explain how Bluemix fits into an agile process.
