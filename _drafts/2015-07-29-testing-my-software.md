An h2 header

Here's a numbered list:

 1. first item
 2. second item
 3. third item

Note again how the actual text starts at 4 columns in (4 characters
from the left side). Here's a code sample:

    # Let me re-iterate ...
    for i in 1 .. 10 { do-something(i) }

As you probably guessed, indented 4 spaces. By the way, instead of
indenting the block, you can use delimited blocks, if you like:ng in another half marathon, this time in County Kerry. I haven't been so far south in Ireland.
